Documenting my hands-on journey through Linux, scripting, CTFs, and cybersecurity fundamentals — from Help Desk to Ethical Hacking.

# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository tracks my progress as I develop hands-on skills in cybersecurity, Linux, and IT support. It includes original writeups, scripts, notes, and tool experiments that reflect my growth from foundational IT (CompTIA A+) to bug bounty hunting and ethical hacking.

## 🎯 Goals:
- Master the Linux command line
- Build and document Bash and Python scripts for automation and recon
- Complete CTFs and OverTheWire challenges to improve problem-solving
- Understand core IT concepts like networking, file systems, and privilege escalation
- Develop tools and workflows for ethical hacking and bug bounty practice

## 🧰 Contents:
- `overthewire/` — Writeups from Bandit and similar Linux-based wargames
- `scripts/` — Custom Bash and Python scripts for recon, enumeration, and automation
- `linux-notes/` — Notes on Linux commands, file permissions, processes, and more
- `ctf-writeups/` — Walkthroughs of retired CTF challenges from TryHackMe and Hack The Box
- `tools-and-labs/` — Setup notes and observations from lab environments like DVWA and Metasploitable

> This portfolio is part of my transition into the cybersecurity field. Everything here is built from the ground up as I learn, break, and rebuild systems in legal lab environments. Contributions, feedback, and mentorship are always welcome.
